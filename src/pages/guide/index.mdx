_**THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY AN EARLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS.**_

*We're looking to organize these resources properly with the aim of giving people a more step-by-step guide, pointing people to what is relevant for their specific stage in their career development, and explaining why we recommend certain resources or what order to read them in. We also intend on this page to be relevant to everybody no matter the stage of career development, from highschoolers looking for where to start, to university students, and graduates of all years of experience. If you would like to contribute, chat with us on Discord, or send us pull requests!*
